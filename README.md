    <h3>Localization of a GNSS denied UAV <br> relative to a Moving Local Reference Frame in an Offshore Environment</h3>

<p align="justify">
Project deals with the problem of localizing a GNSS denied Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in an offshore environment, where the aim of the UAV is to track a moving surface vessel. Due to the homogeneity of an offshore environment, the UAV is unable to localize relative to static features. Therefore, a method for localizing the UAV relative to the surface vessel is developed. This poses challenges in that the surface vessel is moving both according to its own volition and due to external influences from the sea, which means that its local frame is non-inertial. The aim of this thesis is to localize relative to the surface vessel in spite of these challenges, in a manner that allows the drone to fly autonomously using the localization as feedback.
